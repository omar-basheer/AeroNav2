# Flight Path Finder

This project is a Java application that finds the shortest flight path between two airports. It uses data from CSV files to build a graph of airports and routes, and then applies a search algorithm to find the shortest path.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Java installed on your machine to run this application. You can download it from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

### Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/omar-basheer/AeroNav2
```

### Running the Application

The main entry point of the application is the `Main` class in the `src/Main.java` file. You can run the application in your IDE or from the command line with the following command:

```sh
javac src/*.java && java -cp src Main
```

This will run the application with the default input file (`tests/input.txt`) and write the output to `tests/output.txt`.
